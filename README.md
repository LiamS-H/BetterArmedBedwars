## Mod Details
_This mod completely overhauls the sounds and visuals for Armed Bedwars. It adds custom models, sounds, and animations to each gun._
- **Client-Side:** This mod is entirely cosmetic and designed to run on the Hypixel server.
- **Requires Optifine:** This mod requires Optifine to function properly.

### Changes Made

- **Sound Distinction:**
  - Distinguishes between sound sources so that previously shared sounds can be unique.
  - Removes the animation played when items change durability.
  - Comes with a new improved texture pack to utilize these changes.

- **Reload Animations:**
  - Distinct reload sounds (each weapon has a reload sound that matches its animation).
  - Kill and Death sounds are now unique.
  - Fire and Flamethrower sounds are now unique.

## Is this mod allowed on Hypixel?

Let's look at [Hypixel's Allowed Modifications](https://support.hypixel.net/hc/en-us/articles/6472550754962-Hypixel-Allowed-Modifications).

While Hypixel does not directly sign off on any mods:
> "Before using any modifications please be aware that all use of modifications on our server is at your own risk, including the ones we list as examples in this guide. We cannot review every version of every modification, and as such we cannot provide any guarantees of modifications being within our server rules."

There is a section allowing Aesthetic Modifications:
> "Aesthetic Modifications
> Modifications that change only the look and feel of the game without modifying gameplay, such as standard shader modifications or even resource packs. However, these must not change the properties of blocks (e.g. make non-transparent blocks transparent) or change the player's perspective (e.g. allowing them to see around or over objects they normally wouldn't be able to)."

My mod does not modify gameplay, does not change any block textures, and does not change player perspective.

## Disclaimer

While this mod is designed with Hypixel's Allowed Modifications in mind, I cannot guarantee that its use complies with all server rules. Use this mod at your own risk, and be aware that modifications may result in penalties.
